## Why?

Do you want to fix an error you have found? Do you know a way to improve my
Verilog-fu or do you know a technique on Hardware Design that might help here? I
am open for discussion and welcome any help!

## How?

There are many ways to help me out. One way might be to open an issue on
[Github's tracker](https://github.com/mssola/hdl/issues) and start a discussion.
For this, mind the following:

- Try to be concise and precise in your description.
- If you have found a problem, provide a step by step guide on how to reproduce it.
- Provide the version you are using for verilate, GCC, etc.

Another way is to simply submit a pull request. For this, also mind these:

- Write a [good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- The pull request has *only* one subject and a clear title. You are not
  submitting a pull request with tons of different unrelated commits.
